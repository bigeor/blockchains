## The World's Worst Database - Bitcoin Blockchain Mining

- Uses approximately the same amount of electricity as could power an average American household
  for a day per transaction
- Supports 3 transactions / second across a global network with millions of CPUs/purpose-built ASICs
- Takes over 10 minutes to "commit" a transaction
- Doesn't acknowledge accepted writes: requires you read your writes,
  but at any given time you may be on a blockchain fork, meaning your write might not actually
  make it into the "winning" fork of the blockchain (and no, just making it into the mempool doesn't count).
  In other words: "blockchain technology" cannot by definition tell you if a given write is ever
  accepted/committed except by reading it out of the blockchain itself (and even then)
- Can only be used as a transaction ledger denominated in a single currency,
  or to store/timestamp a maximum of 80 bytes per transaction

**Quotes - Blockchains are the next Internets / Tulips**

> People who compare digital tokens to tulips are essentially saying digital tokens are a bubble backed
> by nothing but pure hype and speculation.
>
> What they fail to understand is that tulips come from dirt, not a blockchain.
>
> And as we all know, blockchain is possibly the best technological innovation since the internet.
> It will have a tremendous impact on global business and society in general.

Adding Transactions:

``` ruby
b0 = Block.first(
        { from: "Dutchgrown", to: "Vincent", what: "Tulip Bloemendaal Sunset", qty: 10 },
        { from: "Keukenhof",  to: "Anne",    what: "Tulip Semper Augustus",    qty: 7  } )

b1 = Block.next( b0,
        { from: "Flowers", to: "Ruben", what: "Tulip Admiral van Eijck",  qty: 5 },
        { from: "Vicent",  to: "Anne",  what: "Tulip Bloemendaal Sunset", qty: 3 },
        { from: "Anne",    to: "Julia", what: "Tulip Semper Augustus",    qty: 1 },
        { from: "Julia",   to: "Luuk",  what: "Tulip Semper Augustus",    qty: 1 } )

b2 = Block.next( b1,
